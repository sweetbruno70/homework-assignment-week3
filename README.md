Week 3 Challenge UCB Bootcamp - Buggy Password Generator

This webpage was created to fulfill the UC Berkley bootcamps' homework assignment, and to develop an understanding of JavaScript. My knowledge of JavaScript is elementary,
so bugs that may are invisible to me may be easily identified by a seasoned programmer.

Collaborators: The creation of this password generator would not have been possible without the starter code written by my instructor, Samantha Randolph. The started code can be found
in the UC Berkley's Week 3, Day 3 Zoom presentation. To gain understanding of other people's mindset in writing codes, I read previous students' published codes, including Sarah Durk's and dfel08's codes. 
While their codes gave me some understanding of writing codes, they were quite complicated for my current grasp of the subject. I also spent more than 10 hours watching
youtube videos and Google searching concepts to make sense of the subject, but my understanding is so limited which caused more frustration.
